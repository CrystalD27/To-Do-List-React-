## Overview
I believe myToDos can make users' life easier. I created myToDos to help people stay organized and manage their daily tasks more efficiently. As someone who has struggled with staying on top of my own to-do's, I know how overwhelming it can be to juggle multiple responsibilities at once. By creating a user-friendly app that allows people to easily create, edit, and manage their tasks, I hope to make it easier for them to prioritize their work, stay focused, and achieve their goals.
